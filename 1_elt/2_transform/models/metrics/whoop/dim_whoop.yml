      Dimension table containing distinct workout activity names from WHOOP workouts with classification flags.
      This table provides a lookup/reference table for activity types and their categorization.
      
      **Contains:**
      - **Activity identifier**: whoop_workout_activity_name_id (surrogate key for activity names)
      - **Activity name**: Distinct activity names extracted from fct_whoop_workouts
      - **Classification flag**: is_sport_exercise (boolean indicating if activity is considered sport/exercise vs. general activity)
      
      **Classification Logic:**
      - Activities marked as NOT sport/exercise (is_sport_exercise = false):
        - Walking
        - Communting (commuting)
        - Dance
        - Table Tennis/Ping Pong
      - All other activities are marked as sport/exercise (is_sport_exercise = true)
      
      **Use this table when you need:**
      - Activity type lookups and reference data
      - Filtering workouts by sport/exercise classification
      - Categorizing activities for analysis
      - Joining with fct_whoop_workouts for activity classification
      - Creating activity type hierarchies or groupings
      
      **Note**: This dimension table is derived from fct_whoop_workouts and contains one row per unique activity_name. Use this for filtering or grouping workouts by activity type.
      **Source**: Based on distinct activity names from WHOOP workout data in fct_whoop_workouts.

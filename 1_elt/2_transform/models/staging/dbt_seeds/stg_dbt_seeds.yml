      Staging model for activity mapping seed data. This model standardizes activity names 
      from different sources (Strava, Whoop) to a unified naming convention and identifies 
      which activities are considered sport/exercise activities.
    columns:
      - name: activity_name
        description: Original activity name from the source system (Strava or Whoop).
